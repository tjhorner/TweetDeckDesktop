TweetDeck in the form of a desktop app. Built off of [`electron-boilerplate`](https://github.com/szwacz/electron-boilerplate).

**:warning: This application is far from complete!** Logging in is extremely broken (but there's a workaround explained below), it memory leaks like crazy, and some other stuff that I probaly haven't caught yet. If you want to help fix bugs or add features, please do! Your help will be greatly appreciated <3

## Features

- JavaScript plugins
- Desktop notifications
- CSS themes (soon)
